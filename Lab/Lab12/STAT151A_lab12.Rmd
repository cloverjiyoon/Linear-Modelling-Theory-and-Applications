# Classification trees

The [rpart vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/vignettes/longintro.pdf)
has all the details about `rpart`. Some of the notes below are adapted from there.

In a tree estimator, you can think of your dataset as a crowd of people
that start at the top of the tree and walk downward. At each node is a sign
telling people to go right or left depending on their characteristics (e.g.,
go left if you are under 18 years old, otherwise go right).

In the case of classification, you have some unknown
categorical variable (not necessarily binary), say, "favorite color,"
and you hope that at the bottom of the tree, each terminal node has
a group of people that mostly like the same color.
In other words, the broad goal is to choose good splitting criteria at each node
so that the "purity" of the groups increases after the split.

### Impurity measures

How do we measure impurity at a node $G$ [before a split]?
Suppose the response variable has $1,\ldots,C$ categories,
and the proportion of the $n_G$ people [at this node $G$] in each category are
$p_1, \ldots, p_C$ respectively.
[This is different than the $\bar{p}_1$ and $\bar{p}_2$ in your lecture notes,
which correspond to binary classification proportions in two different groups.]

The **impurity** of the group of datapoints at this node is
$$I(G) = f(p_1) + f(p_2) + \cdots + f(p_C),$$
for some concave function $f$ with $f(0)=f(1)=0$. (This latter condition
ensures $I(G)=0$ if $G$ is pure.)

In lecture, we only considered *binary classification*  (label $0$ or $1$).
There, if $p$ denotes the proportion of the $n_G$ people with label $1$,
the impurity is simply
$$I(G) = f(p) + f(1-p).$$

Examples of $f$:

- **Gini index**: $f(p) = p(1-p)$. In general, $I(G) = \sum_{i=1}^C p_i(1-p_i) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^C p_i^2$ In binary classification, $I(G)=2p(1-p)$.
- **Cross-entropy, deviance, information index**: $f(p) = - p\log p$. In general, $I(G) = -\sum_{i=1}^C p_i \log p_i$. In binary classification, $I(G) = - p \log p - (1-p) \log(1-p)$.
- **Misclassification error**: $f(p) = \min\{p,1-p\}$. In general, $I(G) = \sum_{i=1}^C \min\{p_i, 1- p_i\}$. In binary classification, $I(G) = 2 \min\{p, 1-p\}$. *This is not a good splitting criterion, see below.*

Above, the various factors of $2$ do not really matter, since we are concerned with *comparing*
the value of the impurity for different values of $p$.

The following is a plot of the various impurity measures in the case of binary classification.
```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
p <- seq(1e-3, 1 - 1e-3, length.out=100)
dat <- data.frame(p=p, Gini=2*p*(1-p), Entropy=-(p*log(p)+(1-p)*log(1-p))/log(2)/2, Class=pmin(p, 1-p))
dat.melt <- melt(dat, id.vars="p", variable.name="Impurity")
ggplot(dat.melt, aes(x=p, y=value)) + geom_line(aes(group=Impurity, linetype=Impurity)) + theme_classic()
```

Again, the values of curve do not really matter, since we can scale each curve by any
constant to get an equivalent impurity measure. It is the shape of the curve that matters.
For visualization's sake, I have chosen to scale by constants so that $f(1/2)$
has the same value.



Suppose we split $G$ into two groups $G_L$ and $G_R$ of size $n_L$ and $n_R$ respectively.
The **impurity reduction**
of this split is
$$\Delta I := \frac{1}{n}\left[n_G I(G) - n_L I(G_L) - n_R I(G_R)\right],$$
where $n$ is the number of datapoints in the full dataset.
We want to choose a split (i.e., choose a variable $X_j$ and a cutoff $c$)
that maximizes this impurity reduction, which is equivalent to minimizing
$$n_L I(G_L) + n_R I(G_R).$$

Suppose we are in a binary classification situation, and we let $p_L$ and $p_R$
denote the proportion of $1$s in $G_L$ and $G_R$ respectively. [These are the $\bar{p}_1$ and $\bar{p}_2$ from your lecture notes.]

- Gini: we want to minimize $2 [n_L p_L(1-p_L) + n_R p_R(1-p_R)]$. Note that you showed that this is equivalent to the RSS in a regression tree if you treat the response variable as numerical in $\{0,1\}$.
- Cross-entropy: we want to minimize $-n_L[p_L \log p_L + (1-p_L) \log (1-p_L)] - n_R [p_R \log p_R + (1-p_R) \log (1-p_R)]$.
- Misclassification error: we want to minimize $2 [n_L \min\{p_L, 1-p_L\} + n_R \min\{p_R, 1-p_R\}]$.


By default, `rpart` uses Gini. You can also use the entropy by passing in an argument (see below).

Using misclassification error as a splitting criterion has drawbacks, so I don't think `rpart`
offers an option to use it.

Suppose in the full dataset we have a binary response variable that is $1$ for $80$
of the datapoints, and $0$ for the other $20$. If our first split gives us $G_L$
with $40$ datapoints all labeled with $1$, while $G_R$ has $40$ datapoints labeled $1$
and $20$ datapoints labeled $0$, then what is the impurity reduction $\Delta I$?

- For misclassification error it is $\Delta I = \frac{1}{100}\left[100\cdot \frac{20}{100} - 40 \cdot 0 - 60 \cdot \frac{20}{60} \right] = 0$.
- For Gini and entropy, you can check that $\Delta I > 0$.

So, despite this split being quite good, the misclassification error impurity measure does not really recognize it.
The issue is the linearity of the misclassification error impurity function.
Note that we are measuring the impurity of a split by a weighted average of two impurities.
The strict concavity of the Gini and entropy functions ensures that after a split,
the impurity strictly decreases. The picture below (taken from [here](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/decisiontree-error-vs-entropy.html))
visualizes this.

### Stopping criteria and pruning

We have discussed how to choose splits, but when do we stop?

<img style="float: right;" src="groot.png" width="250px">

For a nonnegative **complexity criterion** $\alpha$ (denoted as `cp` in `rpart`),
we define the **cost complexity** of a tree $T$ by
$$C_\alpha(T) := C(T) + \alpha C(T_{\text{root}}) |T|,$$
where $C(\cdot)$ returns some notion of error/risk of a tree,
and $T_{root}$ is the tree with no splits (just root node).

- In the case of regression trees, we used $C(T)=\text{RSS}(T)$ and thus $C(T_{\text{root}})=\text{TSS}$,
which gives the formula in your lecture notes.
- For classification, we use $C(T)=\frac{\#\text{errors}}{n}$. **Exercise.** In words, what is $C(T_{\text{root}})$?


<small>
*Warning:* sometimes you will see $C_\alpha(T)$ defined as $C(T) + \alpha |T|$ instead
(e.g., compare pages 12 and 24 of the [rpart vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/vignettes/longintro.pdf)).
This does not really matter too much, since $C(T_{\text{root}})$ is a constant
that does not depend on $T$. But `cp` in `rpart` is defined using the earlier definition.
</small>

`rpart` has various stopping criteria. See `help(rpart.control)` for some of these parameters.

- `minsplit` (default is `20`): The minimum number of observations that must exist in a node in order for a split to be attempted. This parameter can save computation time, since smaller nodes are almost always pruned away by cross validation.
- `minbucket` (default is `minsplit/3`): The minimum number of observations in a terminal node.
- `cp` (default is `0.01`): The threshold complexity parameter.

`rpart` continues splitting until either the `minsplit` or `minbucket` conditions are violated,
or if a split does not decrease the cost $C_\alpha$ of the tree.
Specifically, suppose $T$ is a tree and $T'$ is a tree with one more split that we are considering.
Then
$$C_\alpha(T) - C_\alpha(T') = [C(T) - C(T')] - \alpha C(T_{\text{root}}).$$
This gives a nice interpretation of $\alpha$: `rpart` will not consider a split
if $C(T) - C(T')$ (the decrease in error)  is smaller than $\alpha C(T_{\text{root}})$.
Thus if we use $\alpha = 0$, then `rpart` will construct the entire tree (up to the `minsplit` and `minbucket` conditions.)
If we use $\alpha=1$, then `rpart` will not split beyond the root.


So after calling `rpart` with some fixed value of $\alpha$ (a.k.a. `cp`, default value is `0.01`),
we obtain some tree.
How can we prune with `rpart`? If we use `printcp()`, it shows what happens
if we consider sub-trees that result from using values of $\alpha$ larger than
whatever the `cp` value was in our original call to `rpart()`,
along with cross-validation scores for each value of $\alpha$.
[Why do larger values of $\alpha$ yield smaller trees?]
As you continuously increase $\alpha$ to $1$, you will get a finite number of
sub-trees, and I believe `printcp()` lists one value of $\alpha$ for each sub-tree.
You can then use `prune()` to produce a sub-tree using one of the other values of $\alpha$.


### Example

In lecture you looked at some code for a regression tree example.
Here we will look at a classification tree example.

```{r warning=F}
library(DAAG)
data(spam7)
help(spam7)
spam = spam7
```


```{r}
library(rpart)
sprt = rpart(yesno ~ ., method = "class", data = spam)
plot(sprt, margin=0.1)
text(sprt)
sprt
```

Make sure you understand how to read every part of the text output.

As mentioned earlier, the default call to `rpart` uses Gini. To use entropy,
you need to pass another argument, as follows.

```{r}
isprt = rpart(yesno ~ ., method = "class", parms = list(split = 'information'), data = spam)
plot(isprt, margin=0.1)
text(isprt)
isprt
```





$$\begin{array}{c|cc}
& \text{predict $0$} & \text{predict $1$}
\\ \hline
\text{actual $0$} & a & b
\\
\text{actual $1$} & c & d
\end{array}$$

- **Precision** is $\frac{d}{b+d}$
- **Recall** is $\frac{d}{c+d}$

```{r}
confusion <- function (y, yhat, thres)
{
  n <- length(thres)
  conf <- matrix(0,length(thres),ncol=4)
  colnames(conf) <- c("a","b","c","d")
  for ( i in 1:n)
  {
    a <- sum((!y) & (yhat<=thres[i]))
    b <- sum((!y) & (yhat>thres[i]))
    c <- sum((y) & (yhat<=thres[i])) 
    d <- sum((y) & (yhat>thres[i]))
    conf[i,] <- c(a,b,c,d)
  }
  return(conf)
}
```


```{r}
y.tr = predict(sprt, spam)[,2]
thres <- seq(0.05, 0.95, by = 0.05)
y = as.numeric(spam$yesno == "y")
tree.conf = confusion(y, y.tr, thres)
qplot(thres, tree.conf[,2]+tree.conf[,3], xlab="threshold", ylab="b+c", geom="line") + theme_classic()
# pick threshold 0.5
conf <- as.vector(tree.conf[which(thres==0.5),])
precision <- conf[4] / (conf[2] + conf[4])
recall <- conf[4] / (conf[3] + conf[4])
c(precision, recall)
```






You can modify the $\alpha$ value you want to use in the original call to `rpart`.
```{r}
set.seed(0)
dense.sprt <- rpart(yesno ~ ., method="class", data=spam, cp=0.001)
plot(dense.sprt, margin=0.1)
text(dense.sprt)
```

Be careful when reading the `printcp` output. the `rel error` and `xerror`
columns are *not* the misclassification errors [on the full dataset] and cross-validation
errors. You need to multiply each column by the `Root node error` above the
table to get the actual errors. The scaling is chosen so that the first row
always has `rel error` and `xerror` equal to `1.0`, for readability.

We can pick the value of $\alpha$ that has smallest cross-validation error.
(Remember, the cross-validation errors are random.)
In practice one might instead follow the "1 standard error" rule; see
discussion of `lambda.1se` in `glmnet` below.
```{r}
table.cp <- printcp(dense.sprt)
cp.x <- table.cp[which.min(table.cp[,4]), 1]
cp.x
```



```{r}
fsprt <- rpart(yesno ~ ., method="class", data=spam, cp=cp.x)
plot(fsprt, margin=0.1)
text(fsprt)
fconf <- table(spam$yesno, as.numeric(predict(fsprt)[,2] >= 0.5))
fconf
fconf <- as.vector(t(fconf))
fprecision <- fconf[4] / (fconf[2] + fconf[4])
frecall <- fconf[4] / (fconf[3] + fconf[4])
c(fprecision, frecall)
```

Compare with our original model with default `cp=0.01`.
```{r}
plot(sprt, margin=0.1)
text(sprt)
c(precision, recall)
```




### An example with categorical explanatory variables

```{r}
trn <- read.csv("train_titanic.csv", header = TRUE)
rt <- rpart(Survived ~ as.factor(Pclass)+ Sex + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked,
            method="class", data=trn)  
plot(rt, margin=0.1)
text(rt)
rt
```

<img src="tibshirani2017.jpg" width="400px">

### Motivation

Let us center and normalize (divide by standard deviation) the columns of our
design matrix $X$ to put all the variables on the same scale,
and let us center our response variable $y$. Then we will not have an intercept term.

At the beginning of the course, I mentioned the following result which holds for any
$n \times p$ matrix $X$.
$$X^\top X \text{ is invertible} \iff \text{rank}(X) = p.$$
Also recall the fact $\text{rank}(X) \le \min\{n, p\}$.
**Exercise.** If $p > n$, how many solutions $\widehat{\beta}$ are there
to the normal equation $X^\top X \widehat{\beta} = X^\top y$?

Some notation: the $\ell_q$ norm is defined by $\|x\|_q = \left(\sum_i |x_i|^q\right)^{1/q}$. So the $\ell_2$ norm is $\|x\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}$,
also known as the Euclidean norm. Also, the $\ell_1$ norm is $\|x\|_1 = \sum_i |x_i|$.

*Ridge regression** has two equivalent formulations. One is the constrained form with a radius $c$ as a tuning parameter.
$$\widehat{\beta}_{RR} = \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p : \|\beta\|_2 \le c} \|y - X\beta\|_2^2$$
The other is the Lagrangian/penalized form with penalty parameter $\lambda$.
$$\widehat{\beta}_{RR} = \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p} \|y - X\beta\|^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_2^2$$
Each $c \ge 0$ corresponds to some value of $\lambda \ge 0$ and vice versa, but this is not a one-to-one
correspondence.

**Exercise.** Qualitatively how do $c$ and $\lambda$ depend on each other? Specifically,
incresing $c$ corresponds to increasing $\lambda$ or decreasing $\lambda$?

The constrained formulation is good for intuition (see pictures below), but
we typically focus on the penalized formulation in practice.

**Exercise.** Show that $X^\top X + \lambda I_p$ is invertible.  (Hint 1: What is an equivalent condition for invertibility? Hint 2: How do the eigenvalues of $X^\top X$ relate to the eigenvalues of $X^\top X + \lambda I_p$? Hint 3: $X^\top X$ is positive semi-definite, i.e. it has nonnegative eigenvalues.)

**Exercise.** Show that (with the penalized formulation of ridge regression),
$$\widehat{\beta} = (X^\top X + \lambda I_p)^{-1} X^\top y.$$
(Hint: set the gradient of the objective function to zero.) How many solutions are there?

**Exercise.** The fitted value $\widehat{y} = X \widehat{\beta}_{RR}$ can be written as $\widehat{y} = H_\lambda y$, i.e., this is a linear estimator. Write down $H_\lambda$. Its trace is the effective degrees of freedom of this estimator; check that this is $p$ when $\lambda=0$.

**Exercise.** Roughly argue why this is a biased estimator of $\beta$.

<img src="ridge.png" width="800px" >


**LASSO** is defined similarly.
One is the constrained form with a radius $c$ as a tuning parameter.
$$\widehat{\beta}_{LASSO} = \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p : \|\beta\|_1 \le c} \|y - X\beta\|_2^2$$
The other is the Lagrangian/penalized form with penalty parameter $\lambda$.
$$\widehat{\beta}_{LASSO} = \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p} \|y - X\beta\|^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_1$$
Again, we focus on the penalized formulation.

<small>
Here are a few properties regarding the solution set of this optimization problem (see Lemma 1 of [this paper](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/lassounique.pdf)).

- The LASSO solution is either unique or there are infinitely many solutions.
- Every LASSO solution $\widehat{\beta}$ gives the same fitted value $X \widehat{\beta}$.
- If $\lambda > 0$, then every LASSO solution $\widehat{\beta}$ has the same $\ell^1$ norm $\|\widehat{\beta}\|_1$.

</small>

Let us visualize the constrained formulations of ridge regression and LASSO
in the case $p=2$. In both cases, the objective function that we seek to minimize
is $f(\beta) = \|y - X \beta\|^2$, which is a quadratic function in the vector $\beta$,
so it can be shown to have elliptical contours.
The constraint sets $\|\beta\|_2 \le c$ and $\|\beta\|_1 \le c$ are
a circle and a square respectively.


<img src="lasso.png" width="600px">

**Exercise.** In terms of the contours and the two constraint sets, describe where the solution
to ridge regression and LASSO appear in the above pictures. In particular, what is $\widehat{\beta}_1$ in the LASSO solution?

**Exercise.** Explain why in the above pictures $n \le p$.

**Exercise.** Compare the ridge and LASSO solutions with the OLS solution. Why are these methods sometimes referred to as "shrinkage" estimators?

**Exercise.** When the radius $c$ is very large, what are the solutions to each optimization problem?


The above picture attempts to illustrate an attractive property of the LASSO estimator:
it tends to return solutions that are **sparse** (having few nonzero entries).
This suggests another possible advantage of LASSO beyond being able to deal with the case $p > n$:
if the true parameter $\beta$ is sparse (i.e., only a few of the $p$ explanatory variables actually enter our linear model $y = X \beta + \epsilon$), then maybe LASSO can do a good job estimating $\beta$.

Why don't we do best subset selection instead? We could ask for
$$\min_{\beta : \sum_{j=1}^p I(\beta_j \ne 0) \le k} \|y - X \beta \|^2,$$
i.e. look for the $\beta$ that gives the best fit among all $\beta$ that have
$\le k$ nonzero components. (Recall that this is essentially what `regsubsets` does.)
However, as the number of subsets you need to explore grows exponentially in $k$
Even the toy example below with the modest sizes $n=100$, $p=150$, and $k\approx p/4$
takes a long time. (Note that $\binom{p}{k}$ here is already on the order of $10^{35}$.) Imagine what happens when $p$ is even larger.

```{r warning=F}
library(leaps)
library(glmnet)
n <- 100
p <- 150
k <- floor(p / 4)
X <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), n, p)
beta <- rep(0, p)
idx <- sample(1:p, k)
beta[idx] <- 1
beta
y <- X %*% beta + rnorm(n, sd=0.5)

# run these lines to freeze your computer
# rs <- regsubsets(x=X, y=y, nvmax=k, really.big=T)
# summary(rs)
```


It turns out that it is possible to solve the LASSO optimization problem
using "hill climbing" methods; in R, `glmnet` uses coordinate descent.
Running `glmnet` on the above example is almost instantaneous.



<small>
Side note: ridge regression and LASSO arise naturally from a Bayesian perspective
by considering the Gaussian prior and the Laplace prior respectively, on the coefficients $\beta_j$.
</small>

### Using `glmnet`

The [glmnet vignette](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html) is very useful.
The following examples are from [here](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/josh/LASSO_Ridge_Elastic_Net_-_Examples.html).

`glmnet` by solves the following problem
$$\min_{\beta_0, \beta} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta^\top x_i)^2 + \lambda \left[\frac{\alpha}{2} \|\beta\|_2^2 +  (1-\alpha) \|\beta\|_1\right].$$

Where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is a parameter `alpha` to be passed into the call to `glmnet()`.
By default `alpha=1` which gives LASSO. To do ridge regression, choose `alpha=0`.
Intermediate values of `alpha` give a mixture of the two penalties; this general
estimator is called **elastic net regularization**.

A call to `glmnet` will solve this optimization problem for many values of $\lambda$.
You can manually specify how many values of $\lambda$ to try by changing `nlambda` (default is `100`),
or even pass in your own sequence of $\lambda$ values to `lambda`.

```{r message=F}
library(glmnet)
```

Let us consider an example where $p=2000$ but only $k=20$ entries of $\beta$ are nonzero.

```{r}
set.seed(0)
n <- 1000
p <- 2000
k <- 20
X <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), n, p)
beta <- c(rep(1, k), rep(0, p-k))
y <- X %*% beta + rnorm(n)

idx <- sample(1:n, 0.66*n)
X.train <- X[idx,]
y.train <- y[idx]
X.test <- X[-idx,]
y.test <- y[-idx]
```

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# LASSO
fit <- glmnet(X.train, y.train)
plot(fit)
plot(fit, xvar="lambda")
fit
```

You can pick a particular value of $\lambda$ to use for prediction by using the `s` parameter.
```{r}
# Manually pick some lambda
lambda <- 0.6
head(coef(fit, s=lambda), 31)
yhat.lambda <- predict(fit, newx=X.test, s=lambda)
mean((yhat.lambda - y.test)^2)
```

Alternatively you can pick $\lambda$ by cross-validation by using `cv.glmnet`.
```{r}
cvfit <- cv.glmnet(X.train, y.train)
plot(cvfit)
log(cvfit$lambda.min)
log(cvfit$lambda.1se)
```

`lambda.min` is the choice of $\lambda$ that minimizes the cross validation error.
`lambda.1se` is the largest lambda (resulting in more shrinkage) such that the
cross validation is within one standard error of the minimum.
Apparently `lambda.1se` is a standard choice; erring on the side of parsimony (simpler model)
helps mitigate the fact that the cross validation errors are only estimates of the risk curves.
[See [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/138569/why-is-lambda-plus-1-standard-error-a-recommended-value-for-lambda-in-an-elastic) for more discussion.]


```{r}
head(coef(cvfit, s=cvfit$lambda.1se), 31)
yhat.cvlambda <- predict(cvfit, newx=X.test, s=cvfit$lambda.1se)
mean((yhat.cvlambda - y.test)^2)
```


Let's look at ridge regression

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# Ridge
fit <- glmnet(X.train, y.train, alpha=0)
plot(fit)
plot(fit, xvar="lambda")
```


```{r}
cvfit <- cv.glmnet(X.train, y.train, alpha=0)
plot(cvfit)
head(coef(cvfit, s=cvfit$lambda.1se), 31)
yhat.cvlambda <- predict(cvfit, newx=X.test, s=cvfit$lambda.1se)
mean((yhat.cvlambda - y.test)^2)
```


Let's compare LASSO, ridge, and some other choices of the elastic net parameter $\alpha$.
Recall that in our example example where $p=2000$ but only $k=20$ entries of $\beta$ are nonzero,
and we have $n=1000$ datapoints.

```{r net1}
t <- 5
fits <- list()
MSEs <- rep(0, t+1)
for (i in 0:t) {
  fits[[i+1]] <- cv.glmnet(X.train, y.train, alpha=i/t)
  yhat <- predict(fits[[i+1]], newx=X.test, s=fits[[i+1]]$lambda.1se)
  MSEs[i+1] <- mean((yhat - y.test)^2)
}
MSEs
(which.min(MSEs) - 1)/t
```

LASSO does best in this case because few components of the true $\beta$ are nonzero.

Let's now consider an example where there are a lot more nonzero coefficients.

```{r}
set.seed(0)
n <- 1000
p <- 2000
k <- 500
X <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), n, p)
beta <- c(rep(1, k), rep(0, p-k))
y <- X %*% beta + rnorm(n)

idx <- sample(1:n, 0.66*n)
X.train <- X[idx,]
y.train <- y[idx]
X.test <- X[-idx,]
y.test <- y[-idx]
```

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
fit.l <- glmnet(X.train, y.train)
plot(fit.l, xvar="lambda")
fit.r <- glmnet(X.train, y.train, alpha=0)
plot(fit.r, xvar="lambda")
```



```{r net2}
t <- 5
fits <- list()
MSEs <- rep(0, t+1)
for (i in 0:t) {
  fits[[i+1]] <- cv.glmnet(X.train, y.train, alpha=i/t)
  yhat <- predict(fits[[i+1]], newx=X.test, s=fits[[i+1]]$lambda.1se)
  MSEs[i+1] <- mean((yhat - y.test)^2)
}
MSEs
(which.min(MSEs) - 1)/t
```

Here ridge regression does best.
Here the sparsity of the true $\beta$ is not small enough for LASSO to
have better prediction error than ridge regression (and LASSO probably does not
find the right variables, from looking at the paths plot above).
However, despite the better prediction error, the ridge regression estimate
is not very interpretable since it involves all $p=2000$ variables.


Ridge and elastic net also perform better than LASSO
when the explanatory variables are correlated/colinear. See [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/264118/) for some intuition,
and [here](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/josh/LASSO_Ridge_Elastic_Net_-_Examples.html#example-3) for a simulation.


### Logistic with LASSO

As suggested by the name of the package, `glmnet` can also do regularization
with other GLM models. We simply replace the least squares term $\|y - X \beta\|^2$
with the negative log likelihood of whichever GLM we want.

In the case of logistic regression, it is
$$\min_{\beta_0, \beta} -\left[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i (\beta_0 + x_i^\top \beta) - \log(1+\exp(\beta_0 + x_i^\top\beta))\right] + \lambda \left[\frac{\alpha}{2} \|\beta\|_2^2 +  (1-\alpha) \|\beta\|_1\right].$$

We can ask `glmnet` to use this by adding `family="binomial"` to the call.
Here is an example on the Titanic dataset.

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
titanic <- read.csv("train_titanic.csv")
titanic <- na.omit(titanic)

# need to use model.matrix() to create design matrix for glmnet
dd <- titanic[, c("Survived", "Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Embarked")]
dd$Pclass <- as.factor(dd$Pclass)
X <- model.matrix(Survived~., dd)
X <- X[,-1]

fit <- glmnet(X, titanic$Survived, family="binomial")
plot(fit, xvar="lambda")
cvfit <- cv.glmnet(X, titanic$Survived, family="binomial")
plot(cvfit)
coef(cvfit, s=cvfit$lambda.1se)
```
